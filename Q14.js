//Create an array called'Guestlist'with people you'd like to invite to dinner.
var guestlist = ["Taha", "Ubaid", "Faisal"];
//Print an invitation message for each person in the list 
guestlist.forEach(function (person) {
    console.log("Dear ".concat(person, ",\nWe are invited to dinner!We would be honored to have your company."));
