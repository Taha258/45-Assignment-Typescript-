// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
//Creat an array of magician's names 
var magicians = ['Akber ali', 'Haris', 'Zahid'];
function show_magicians1(magiscians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) {
        return console.log(magician);
    });
}
//call the function to show the magicians
show_magicians1(magicians);
